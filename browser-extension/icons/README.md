# Icon Placeholder

Since this is a text-based environment, I cannot create actual PNG icon files.

To complete the extension, you'll need to create icon files in the following sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Suggested Icon Design:

- Medical cross (‚ûï) or stethoscope (ü©∫) symbol
- Blue/green color scheme to convey trust and health
- Simple, clear design that's readable at small sizes

## Tools to Create Icons:

- **Online**: Canva, Figma, IconBuddy
- **Software**: GIMP, Photoshop, Sketch
- **AI Tools**: DALL-E, Midjourney (prompt: "medical fact check icon, blue cross, simple design")

## Quick Solution:

You can temporarily use Unicode emoji as icons by converting them to PNG:

1. Screenshot the medical emoji: üè• or ‚öïÔ∏è
2. Resize to required dimensions
3. Save as PNG files

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome may show a default puzzle piece icon.
